# landuse-30d
This map was produced by members of LED-UFC, a research group dedicated to expand the investigations about design and planning processes used by arch+urb+design. It was produced for the #30DayMapChallenge (2021) with knowledge from 'Mapping Urban Data', a course offered by Morphocode.

Land use data is being used to represent which social aspect each tax lot fulfills. As a key feature for city planners, it can indicate how facilities and services are distributed over the urban fabric.

The map cutout presented is a initial proposition for the boundaries of a health innovation district in Fortaleza, Brazil. The research project is the result of a partnership between the State Health Department (SESA) and the Federal University of Cear√° (UFC).
